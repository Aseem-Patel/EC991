# EC991 Week 2 lab: the infinite-horizon problem by value function iteration

**Aseem Patel, University of Essex, Autumn 2026**

This notebook stands on its own. Every function it uses is written out in the notebook itself, so it does not need the `EC991Week2` package. Use it if `week02_lab.jl` does not open on your laptop, or if you would rather see all the code in one place. The functions have the same names and the same lines as the package, so every number here matches the lab slides.

**Open this file in Pluto**, as in week 1 (`import Pluto; Pluto.run()`, then paste the file path). Pluto installs `Plots` and `PlutoUI` by itself the first time; that takes a few minutes. Three Pluto rules still apply: cells are reactive, each name is defined in exactly one cell, and several lines in one cell go inside `begin ... end` or `let ... end`.

The finite-horizon problem, solved by backward induction, is in the companion notebook `week02_backward_induction_standalone.jl`.

## 1. The problem and its state

The household chooses savings to maximise lifetime utility. Income is constant at ``y`` (the wage is normalised to one), the gross interest rate is ``R = 1 + r``, and borrowing is limited to ``\phi``:

```math
\max_{\{a_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^{\infty}} \ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t)
\quad \text{s.t.} \quad
c_t + a_{t+1} \leq y + R a_t, \qquad a_{t+1} \geq -\phi .
```

Five numbers describe the household: ``\beta, R, y, \phi, \gamma``. In code they are the fields of one struct, so that every function receives them together instead of as five separate arguments. The defaults are Moll's: ``\beta = 1/1.05`` and ``R = 1.03``, so ``\beta R < 1`` and the household is impatient relative to the interest rate.

## 2. The Bellman equation on a grid

Split the problem into today and everything after. If ``V(a)`` is the best lifetime utility attainable with assets ``a``, then

```math
V(a) \;=\; \max_{a' \,\geq\, -\phi} \ u\big(y + R a - a'\big) + \beta V(a') .

A computer cannot hold a function, so **Step 1** of the algorithm replaces the continuum of asset levels by a grid ``\mathcal{A} = \{a_1, \dots, a_{n_a}\}`` with ``a_1 = -\phi``. Both the state ``a`` and the choice ``a'`` are restricted to the grid. The unknown function ``V`` becomes a vector of ``n_a`` numbers, ``V_i = V(a_i)``.

## 3. One application of the Bellman operator

Write the right-hand side of the Bellman equation as an operator ``T`` that takes a candidate ``V`` and returns a new function ``TV``. On the grid, with ``a'`` restricted to grid points,

```math
(TV)(a_i) \;=\; \max_{k = 1, \dots, n_a} \ u\big(y + R a_i - a_k\big) + \beta V(a_k), \qquad u(c) = -\infty \text{ when } c \leq 0 .
```

For each state ``a_i`` this is a search over ``n_a`` candidates: a double loop. The function below is the whole of Step 3 of the algorithm. Read it against the equation:

| Code | Maths |
|---|---|
| `for i in 1:na` | for each state ``a_i`` |
| `for k in 1:na` | for each candidate ``a'_k`` |
| `c = R * a[i] + y - a[k]` | ``c = y + R a_i - a'_k`` from the budget constraint |
| `c <= 0 && continue` | ``u(c) = -\infty`` for infeasible ``c``, so skip it |
| `v = utility(c, hh) + β * V0[k]` | the Bellman right-hand side ``u(c) + \beta V(a'_k)`` |
| `if v > best` | the ``\max`` |
| `V1[i], pol[i] = best, kbest` | ``(TV)(a_i)`` and the argmax, stored as an index |

`V0` is the function you put in, `V1` the function you get out; `pol[i]` is the **index** ``k`` of the chosen ``a'``, so the policy function is `a[pol]`.

## 4. Iterate to the fixed point

A solution of the Bellman equation is a fixed point, ``V = TV``. Under our assumptions ``T`` is a contraction with modulus ``\beta``: for any two candidates,

```math
\| TV - TW \| \;\leq\; \beta\, \| V - W \| ,
\qquad \| f \| = \max_i |f(a_i)| .
```

Two things follow. The fixed point exists and is unique. And the sequence ``V_\ell = T V_{\ell-1}`` converges to it from any ``V_0``, with the distance between successive iterates shrinking by at least ``\beta`` each time:

```math
d_\ell = \| V_\ell - V_{\ell-1} \| \;\leq\; \beta\, d_{\ell - 1} .
```

That inequality is the algorithm. **Step 3** applies ``T``; **Step 4** stops when ``d_\ell`` is below a tolerance. The solver below is those two steps in a loop around `bellman_step!`. The line `V0, V1 = V1, V0` is the update: the function we just computed becomes the guess for the next round (the two arrays swap roles, so nothing is copied). The struct `Solution` collects what the solver returns.

Only a few dozen iterations, which looks too good for a contraction of modulus ``0.95``. The plot explains it. Every ratio ``d_\ell / d_{\ell-1}`` is at most ``\beta``, as the theorem says, but the distances then collapse to zero: the guess ``V_0`` is **exact** at the borrowing limit (there the household really does consume ``ra + y`` forever), and from every grid point the optimal path reaches the limit in a finite number of periods. Once the iteration count passes that number, nothing is left to correct.

From a worse guess, ``V_0 = 0``, the same Bellman step converges geometrically at rate ``\beta`` and needs a few hundred iterations. Both end at the same ``V``: the fixed point does not depend on where you start, only the number of steps does.

## 7. Exercises

Work in new cells below. Each one reuses the functions above; none needs new solver code.

1. **Patience.** Set ``\beta R = 1`` (for example `Household(β = 1/1.03)`), solve, and simulate from ``a_0 = 2.5``. What happens to the drift in assets, and why? Check the savings policy against the 45-degree line.
2. **Grid coarseness.** Solve with `na = 50` and with `na = 1000`. Compare the consumption functions and the size of the Euler residuals before the limit binds. Which direction does the error move?
3. **Where does the time go?** Use `@time solve_vfi(hh, a)` for `na` of 100, 300 and 1000. The double loop makes each Bellman step cost ``n_a^2`` operations. Does the timing scale that way? This is the cost week 3 attacks.
